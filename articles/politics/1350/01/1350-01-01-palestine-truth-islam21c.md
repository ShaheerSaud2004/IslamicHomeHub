## UNCOVERING REALITIES.

## UNITING VOICES.

## Palestine Truth:

## Standing for Justice

## Defending Palestine means defending our Islamic civilisation. It’s the cradle of our history, the symbol of our struggle, and the beacon of dignity for the Ummah.      Yet, the truth is not being told. Misinformation spreads unchecked, obscuring the reality and distorting justice.        That’s why we’ve launched the 'Palestine Truth' campaign: to expose Zionism and highlight the justice of Islam. By educating, fact-checking, and providing a platform for Palestinian voices, we can correct the lies and stand for justice.
