We hear from [Imam Tom Facchine](https://www.islam21c.com/author/imam-tom-facchine/) as he discusses the rapidly changing Iran-Israel developments following Trump’s bombing of key nuclear facilities on Sunday, the Iranian strike on al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar on Monday, and the bizarre announcement of a ceasefire between the two sides on Tuesday.

With the only certainty with Trump being his unpredictability, what could happen next, is Israel finished (or America)? Who is truly in control of the United States?

All this and more, in this episode.
