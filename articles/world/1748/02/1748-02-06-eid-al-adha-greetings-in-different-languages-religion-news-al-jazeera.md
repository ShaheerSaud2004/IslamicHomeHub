Eid al-Adha, also known as the Feast of the Sacrifice, is observed on the third day of [Hajj](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2025/6/3/hajj-explained-a-visual-step-by-step-guide-to-the-pilgrimage-in-mecca), which falls on the 10th of Dhul-Hijja, the 12th and final month of the Islamic calendar.

Eid al-Adha is the second major festival in the Islamic calendar, celebrated roughly 70 days after Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting.

This year, the first day of Eid al-Adha falls on June 6 in Saudi Arabia and neighbouring countries, while some other countries will mark it on June 7.

There are about 1.9 billion Muslims around the world, approximately 25 percent of the world population. Indonesia has the world’s highest Muslim population, with some 230 million Muslims living in the country. Pakistan is second with about 212 million Muslims, followed by India (200 million), Bangladesh (150 million) and Nigeria (100 million).

In the days leading up to Eid al-Adha, Muslims prepare by preparing their homes, buying new clothes and planning special meals for the occasion.

On the first day of Eid, those who are financially able are required to sacrifice an animal – usually a sheep, goat, cow, or camel – and distribute a portion of the meat to the less fortunate. This act commemorates the Prophet Abraham’s (Ibrahim) willingness to sacrifice his son Ishmail (Ismael) in obedience to God.

The rest of the holiday is spent visiting family and friends, exchanging greetings and gifts, and sharing festive meals.

The most common greeting is Eid Mubarak. The Arabic saying translates to “blessed Eid”.

Here is how people say Eid Mubarak in different languages around the world.
