Demonstrators in support of the LGBT lobby march through the city of Sarajevo, 22 June 2024. The most recent event took place on 14 June 2025. Editorial credit: RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty

Political corruption can be conducted in many different ways. It usually relates to public office, nepotism, usury, money laundering, and the economy.

But there is also a type of social corruption which is being biologically turned against entire populations — mentally and physically. And that is so-called sexual freedoms peddled by the LGBT lobby.

If a community, city, or entire country goes through a devastating war with many dead and a lot of externally displaced refugees, plus genocide to top things off, what would the nation’s natural response after the war and genocide be?

## Our birth rate is rapidly declining!

Improving a birth rate would be encouraged for a people in such a position.

So, too, would be raising awareness of the importance of the nation’s growth, recovering in numbers. In popular English terminology, it would be the promotion and encouragement of the “baby boom”.

Bosnia is a country in such a position. About three decades ago, it went through war and genocide. But the birth rate recovery is still going very slowly, due to economic difficulties and the fact that many people have left. [\[1\]](https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/bih/bosnia/birth-rate)

In general, the whole population needs more encouragement. But today, the public promotion of something completely against that is happening. The promotion of legal and public homosexuality is against the birth rate, for obvious reasons.

## Iftar for the gay believers?

In a country like Bosnia, with a Muslim majority, it might be hard for one to imagine that there was a bizarre event along the lines of “iftar for the gay believers” during a previous Ramadan to the one that just passed.

It was all approved and legalised by authorities. But this type of corruption (although there are people who don’t see it as such) has a deeper base; it’s more complex and sensitive than it seems at first.

Local police and city authorities _nominally_ consider street graffiti as vandalism (individually, they may call it “street art”), but only if football and/or music fans are doing it. It’s certainly not in the case of so-called LGBT activism. As you are reading this, the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo has dozens of pro-homosexual graffiti on its facades.

In the wake of Donald Trump’s sensationalised second term, packed full of new and recycled controversies, and with Ramadan 1446 just gone, here is a reflection on this topic, specifically in my small country of Bosnia, with its native Muslim population still struggling for political survival in its own backyard.

This is the story of the LGBT agenda in Bosnia, and how tight of a political connection it holds.

## LGBT demonstrators vs. Serbian Orthodox Church

First, let’s check the context and background which includes Western diplomacy in the Balkans — not only Bosnia.

In 2022, there were video reports from the Serbian capital, Belgrade, of clashes between public LGBT demonstrators on one side, and Serb nationalist groups followed by the clergy of the Serbian Orthodox Church on the other. [\[2\]](https://www.rferl.org/a/serbia-orthodox-christians-march-against-europride-lgbt/32008715.html)

Most clashes were not direct because special police units were present, mainly attacking those who were opposing public demonstrations of homosexuality.

This wasn’t the first time such protests and counter-protests had taken place in Belgrade. And it wasn’t the first time in the Balkans either. It has been ongoing for some years already.

Indeed, the public promotion and presentation of so-called homosexual movements and agendas has been organised on the streets of other large cities across the Balkans, specifically in what was formerly Yugoslavia.

Each city that experienced such protests had been under pressure by the LGBT lobby — of the external kind that mostly came from the EU and some Western embassies — to allow and organise street parades for the LGBT lifestyle.

Conditions were more or less the same in each Balkan country and city, except maybe for Sarajevo. By no coincidence, this city has a Muslim majority, historically, culturally, geographically, and demographically, while being in the heart of Europe.

## Degradation of the term “civilised”

In 2019, when the first LGBT marches were organised in this city, the American and British ambassadors to Bosnia decided to join in. [\[3\]](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/bosnians-march-in-first-gay-pride-under-tight-police-protection-idUSKCN1VT0KU/)

As a result, security was at such a high level that half of the city centre was blocked for hours, by special anti-riot police. In fact, the protocols included snipers on rooftops!

It almost felt like the city was under siege again, like it was during the Yugoslav war(s) from the 1990s.

These ambassadors made such a fuss about their visible security operations, it was as if the LGBT population was heavily endangered in this city — which is not the case.

Tellingly, a day before the first parade, some local newspapers were publishing titles like,

> Tomorrow, Sarajevo is passing its own civilisational test.”

This was part of that specific pressure on this city, compared to other regional cities.

Not being aware of the absurdity of such a statement, most local media accepted this as a “test of how Sarajevo is civilised or not”.

Of course, the answer depends on what they mean and consider by “being civilised”, especially considering that not only have they reduced modern civilisational standards to the level of the so called “LGBT rights”, but they are imposing their version of “civilisation” onto the city that went through the longest artillery siege in European history — 1,425 days — without seeking revenge. After all, this is a closer meaning of “being civilised”, but perhaps it doesn’t fit within contemporary media standards.

## General Muslim reaction has been weak

### Entire city blocked for one event

In a different year, an LGBT parade was again held in Sarajevo, in the summer. This time, the whole city centre was blocked for almost the entire day.

One would think that public reactions to the equally public promotion of homosexuality would come from believers, scholars, ulamā, muftis. But no, the collective reaction was soft and mostly online by some individual Imams. Even the Bosnian Grand Mufti remained silent on this.

In one instance, a “gay parade” in Sarajevo was literally passing by one of the local mosques at the time that the Duhr adhān was booming from the minaret. Parade participants made noise, shouted, whistled, and drummed. The mosque increased the volume of its speakers, and the parade-goers increased their volume further.

And all the while, there were no concrete reactions from the worshippers.

### Some push-back from Muslims in politics

Just when it seemed nobody would react to this humiliation and public immorality, a small political movement gave some hope.

A counter-parade was organised by the independent Bosnian Islamic and patriotic party called BNS-VND (a rough translation being the “Bosnian Folk’s Party — Faith, People, Country/State”).

This movement gathered around two hundred people and marched the streets of Sarajevo the same day as the LGBT parade, albeit through different parts of the city. A large police presence ensured that the two opposing groups would not meet.

### This disastrous movement affects all of society

The leader of the VND party, theology professor and writer Sanin Musa, invited everybody to join and, indeed, some passers-by did.

VND supporters waved old Bosnian flags and banners with messages about Islamic morality, justice, and logic. Members of the party invited everybody — regardless of their faith — to join them because when children are endangered, it matters to everybody, not only Muslims!

And there is a valid concern that homosexual or otherwise LGBT couples would be legally allowed to adopt children after this dangerous movement becomes widely accepted, as it has happened in many other European countries, while paedophile-inspired organisations saw their chance in this, like in the Netherlands. [\[4\]](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jul/18/topstories3.mainsection)

### There is a right and wrong way to respond

There was not a single incident during the VND counter-demonstrations, with supporters walking the streets of Sarajevo peacefully.

In front of local media, they invited followers of the LGBT ideology to end their parades, _without_ judging them for their views, but warning them based on the Qur’ānic chapter about the people of Lūt (ʿalayhi al-Salām).

At the same time, Professor Musa emphasised that nobody cares about anybody else’s sexual preferences, as long as they are kept personal and private, but the people are certainly against public presentation or even celebration of anybody’s orientation, especially homosexuality.

He also suggested being mindful that this is happening in a country which is still recovering from genocide. Defenders of the public promotion of homosexuality are usually repeating how it is demanded, even dictated, from the EU (although Bosnia is not an EU member).

Musa added that it is demanded by the same EU bureaucracy that was idly watching the devastation of Bosnia for four years, allowing ethnic cleansing and not allowing Bosnia to defend and protect itself just 30 years ago!

## Mainstream media continues to make up stories

### Outlets armed with the usual incorrect labels

With each of these LGBT parades, local secular mainstream media is always ready to criticise almost any public reaction or statement against public homosexuality and the legalisation of gay marriage.

In the case of the parade just mentioned, their journalists were ready to label the VND with the usual banal terminology; words like “extremists”, “homophobes”, “haters”, or “Islamists”.

But in this case they remained rather confused. Even _more_ confused perhaps, after realising that anti-LGBT protests in Belgrade — with Christians and nationalists — were violent compared to these in Sarajevo, organised by one small Islamic political party!

### LGBT lobby believes it is superior to traditional values

Many biased journalists had expected the above event to be violent, perhaps based on global stereotypes. But Sanin Musa and people around him were civilised, not insulting anyone or causing any incidents, urging everyone to demonstrate peacefully, and inviting LGBT organisations to do more meaningful things instead of marching for this cause, and to be aware of the consequences of their actions, to consider tawbah, etc.

And yet, no answer nor comment came from any of the LGBT organisations. It seems that they are at a stage where they arrogantly feel superior to others, just because the mighty US Embassy is behind them, because the powerful European Union stands for them, and local politicians too.

But for how long, nobody was conveniently mentioning.

## Sabotage of the birth rate has major consequences

### External actors harming Bosnia

Registered LGBT movements and organisations in Bosnia are gaining more social and political rights than young parents who are waiting for their babies, or just planning to start a new family.

In most, if not all, cases where these annual parades have taken place, they’ve been sponsored and financed by outside actors.

But besides that support, more recent parades are seeing the new political establishment in Sarajevo also donating significant amounts. Such funds could have been an incentive for young parents, but instead they were given for the opposite purpose.

Three years ago, some Bosnian politicians who are nominally Muslim, approved a discussion about a bill which would enable homosexual couples to get married legally — and based on that — to adopt children one day. It is not fully established law _yet_, but with pressure from the EU it might, since it happened in many other European countries.

Does this sound like the promotion and encouragement of the birth rate in a nation that needs it badly?

### Openly homosexual US ambassador to Bosnia

One of the previous US Ambassadors to Bosnia, Eric Nelson, publicly claimed that he is gay — although it should have been a private matter.

Interestingly, he was nominated to this position during the first Trump administration, even though Trump was mainly supported by Americans “traditionally” against homosexuals. Of course, international diplomacy is more complex and layered than that. So for a couple of years, Eric Nelson was openly spreading a campaign in support of gay movements in Bosnia.

On a few occasions in the last two years, a huge rainbow flag was hoisted from the roof of the US Embassy in Sarajevo — need I remind you that this is a Muslim-majority city?

By now, even those who are not knowledgeable on this topic are aware that the rainbow was hijacked and officially adopted as the international LGBT flag in the late 70s.

In September 2019, Ambassador Nelson even joined an LGBT parade when they were marching the streets, same as his British equivalent (as mentioned above) and other international diplomats working in Bosnia. [\[5\]](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/bosnia-s-1st-lgbtq-pride-parade-1.5272937)

## Far more vulnerable members of society

It is true that, in the past, there have been verbal threats and a handful of individual physical attacks on some who profess to be “homosexual”, but this has not been at a higher rate than in other regional countries, nor has it been in an organised way.

Those responsible for such incidents have been individuals and football hooligans, while the bureaucracy is supportive of LGBT activists. And, as mentioned already, this includes foreign sponsors and the vast majority of the country’s media.

However, there are other groups in Bosnia that are more endangered. Consider refugees, immigrants, Muslims in the remote parts of the Serb nationalist-dominated or Croat-dominated areas of the country, the unemployed, miners, the Roma Gypsy population, disabled veterans from the 1990s aggression on the country, peasants, industry workers, etc.

Why don’t they receive even one fourth of the support, public attention, or help as those of the LGBT grouping, either internationally or locally?

## Genocide followed by cultural erosion

So much is said about the EU forcing “equal rights” onto Bosnia, through so-called sexual freedoms.

The first phase of the genocide that we endured was about the destruction of the population from the _outside_, while this current, ongoing stage is about achieving the slow destruction from _within_.

Through the misuse of diplomacy, through media manipulation, finances, and sophisticated social methods, a lot is at risk, not least the birth rate of Bosnia but also the very fabric of our society.
