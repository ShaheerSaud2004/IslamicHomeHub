UNITED NATIONS, United States: France and its European partners are still prepared to reactivate sanctions on Iran if an agreement is not reached soon on its nuclear program, the French ambassador to the UN warned Tuesday.

“Time is running out,” said Jerome Bonnnafont at a UN Security Council meeting, in reference to the October expiration of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.

“We expect Iran to return to talks without delay in order to achieve a robust, verifiable and lasting diplomatic solution,” he added.

Bonnafont said negotiations were the only way to “guarantee the impossibility of an Iranian military nuclear program,” days after the United States conducted strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities.

“France and its E3 partners (Germany and the United Kingdom) remain ready to use the leverage established by Resolution 2231, that of a ‘snapback’ (of sanctions), if a satisfactory agreement is not reached by summer,” he warned.

UK ambassador Barbara Wood concurred, saying: “We will use all diplomatic levers at our disposal to support a negotiated outcome, and ensure Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon.”

UN Security Council Resolution 2231 endorsed the 2015 agreement Iran reached with the E3 countries, as well as China, Russia and the United States, to regulate its nuclear program in return for eased sanctions.

President Donald Trump removed the United States from the agreement in 2018.

###### Print Edition

WASHINGTON: The whipsaw chain of events involving Iran, Israel and the United States that culminated in a surprise ceasefire has raised many questions about how the Trump administration will approach the Middle East going forward.

Yet, the answer to the bottom line question — “what’s next?” — remains unknowable and unpredictable. That is because President Donald Trump has essentially sidelined the traditional US national security apparatus and confined advice and decision-making to a very small group of top aides operating from the White House.

While there is uncertainty about whether the ceasefire between Iran and Israel will hold, it opens the possibility of renewed talks with Tehran over its nuclear program and reinvigorating stalled negotiations in other conflicts.

**Watching for next steps on Trump’s social media**

Outside experts, long consulted by presidential administrations on policy, have been forced like the general public to follow Trump’s social media musings and pronouncements for insights on his thinking or the latest turn of events.

Even Congress does not appear to be in the loop as top members were provided only cursory notifications of Trump’s weekend decision to hit three Israeli nuclear facilities and briefings on their impact scheduled for Tuesday were abruptly postponed.

State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce, whose agency has played a key role in formulating Iran policy for decades, repeatedly on Tuesday deferred questions to the White House and Trump’s posts.

“The secretary of state was in a dynamic with the president that is a private dynamic as that team was addressing a war and the nature of how to stop it,” she told reporters. “I can’t speak to how that transpired or the decisions that were made.”

Trump’s announcement Monday that Israel and Iran agreed to a ceasefire took many in the administration by surprise — as did his post Tuesday that China is now free to import Iranian oil.

It’s an apparent 180-degree shift from Trump’s “maximum pressure campaign” on Iran since he withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement during his first term. US officials were left wondering if that meant wide-ranging sanctions aimed at cutting off Iran’s energy revenue were being eased or reversed.

**Assessing the damage to Iran’s nuclear program**

While the extent of the damage from 11 days of Israeli attacks and Saturday’s strikes by US bunker-buster bombs is not yet fully known, a preliminary assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency said the nuclear program had been set back only a few months and was not “completely and fully obliterated” as Trump has said.

According to people familiar with the report, it found that while the strikes at the Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan nuclear sites did significant damage, they were not totally destroyed.

Still, most experts believe the facilities will require months or longer to repair or reconstruct if Iran chooses to try to maintain its program at previous levels.

Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, deputy commander of US Central Command, who has been nominated to lead forces in the Middle East, told lawmakers Tuesday that Iran still possesses “significant tactical capability” despite the American strikes. He pointed to Iran’s attempt to retaliate with missile launches at a US base in Qatar.

In response to a question about whether the Iranians still pose a threat to US troops and Americans worldwide, Cooper replied, “They do.”

Trump, after announcing the ceasefire, boasted that Iran will never again have a nuclear program.

However, there are serious questions about whether Iran’s leadership, which has placed a high premium on maintaining its nuclear capabilities, will be willing to negotiate them away.

**Restarting US-Iran nuclear talks is possible**

Another major question is what happens with negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program. It is not entirely clear who in Iran has the authority to make a deal or even agree to reenter talks with the US or others.

Ray Takeyh, a former State Department official and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Iranian leadership is at a moment of disarray — making it difficult to return to the table.

“The country’s leadership and the regime is not cohesive enough to be able to come to some sort of negotiations at this point, especially negotiations from the American perspective, whose conclusion is predetermined, namely, zero enrichment,” he said.

Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, agreed, saying that “the biggest challenge right now is who is in charge in Tehran.”

“Is there an Iranian negotiation team empowered to make consequential decisions?” he said. “The issue is that (Trump) is dealing with an Iranian government whose longtime identity has been based on hostility toward the the United States.”

Still, a US official said Tuesday that special envoy Steve Witkoff is ready to resume negotiations if Trump tells him to and Iran is willing. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters.

Witkoff has maintained an open line of direct communication via text messages with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.

In the aftermath of the US strikes, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio both stressed that diplomacy is still Trump’s preferred method for ending the conflict permanently.

“We didn’t blow up the diplomacy,” Vance told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “The diplomacy never was given a real chance by the Iranians. And our hope … is that this maybe can reset here. The Iranians have a choice. They can go down the path of peace or they can go down the path of this ridiculous brinksmanship.”

Rubio echoed those comments.

“We’re prepared right now, if they call right now and say we want to meet, let’s talk about this, we’re prepared to do that,” he said. “The president’s made that clear from the very beginning: His preference is to deal with this issue diplomatically.”

The Israel-Iran ceasefire could affect Trump’s approach to other conflicts

If it holds, the ceasefire could offer insight to the Trump administration as it tries to broker peace in several other significant conflicts with ties to Iran.

An end — even a temporary one — to the Iran-Israel hostilities may allow the administration to return to talks with mediators like Egypt and Qatar to seek an end to the war between Israel and the Iranian-backed militant group Hamas.

In Syria, a further shift away from now-weakened Iranian influence — pervasive during ousted leader Bashar Assad’s reign — could open new doors for US-Syria cooperation. Trump already has met the leader of the new Syrian government and eased US sanctions.

Similarly, tense US relations with Lebanon also could benefit from a reduced Iranian role in supporting the Hezbollah militant group, which has been a force of its own — rivaling if not outperforming the Lebanese Armed Forces, particularly near the Israeli border.

If an Iran-Israel ceasefire holds, it also could allow Trump the time and space to return to stalled efforts to broker a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine.

Russia and Iran have substantial economic and military cooperation, including Tehran providing Moscow with drones that the Russian military has relied on heavily in its war against Ukraine.

Russia has stepped up attacks on Ukraine in recent days as Israel attacked sites in Iran, perhaps expecting the world’s attention to shift away from its three-year-old invasion.

WASHINGTON: The Trump administration has authorized providing $30 million to a US- and Israeli-backed group that is distributing food in Gaza, a US official said Tuesday, an operation that has drawn criticism from other humanitarian organizations.

The request is the first known US government funding for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’s aid distribution efforts amid the Israel-Hamas war. The American-led group had applied for the money to the US Agency for International Development, which has been dismantled and will soon be absorbed into the State Department as part of the Trump administration’s deep cuts of foreign aid.

The application is part of a controversial development: private contracting firms led by former US intelligence officers and military veterans delivering aid to some of the world’s deadliest conflict zones in operations organized with governments that are combatants in the conflicts.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive diplomatic issue involving a controversial aid program, said the decision to directly fund GHF was made “to provide effective and accessible humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza.”

The announcement comes as violence and chaos have plagued areas near the new food distribution sites since opening last month. GHF says no one has been killed at the aid sites themselves and that it has delivered some 44 million meals to Palestinians in need.

Palestinian witnesses and health officials say Israeli forces have repeatedly opened fire on crowds heading to the sites for desperately needed food, killing hundreds in recent weeks. The Israeli military says it has fired warning shots at people it said approached its forces in a suspicious manner while going to the sites.

Witnesses said Israeli troops opened fire as crowds tried to reach a GHF site on Tuesday in southern Gaza. At least 19 were killed and 50 others wounded, according to Nasser hospital and Gaza’s Health Ministry. The Israeli military did not immediately comment.

Israel wants the GHF to replace a system coordinated by the United Nations and international aid groups. Along with the United States, it accuses Hamas of stealing aid, without offering evidence. The United Nations, its affiliated aid agencies and private humanitarian groups that work in Gaza have denied that there has been any significant theft of their supplies by Hamas.

The Associated Press reported Saturday that the American-led group had asked the Trump administration for the initial funding so it can continue its aid operation, which has been criticized by the UN, humanitarian groups and others. They accuse the foundation of cooperating with Israel’s objectives in the 21-month-old war against Hamas in a way that violates humanitarian principles.

State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters earlier Tuesday that she had no information to provide on funding for the foundation.

WASHINGTON: Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok produced inaccurate and contradictory responses when users sought to fact-check the Israel-Iran conflict, a study said Tuesday, raising fresh doubts about its reliability as a debunking tool.

With tech platforms reducing their reliance on human fact-checkers, users are increasingly utilizing AI-powered chatbots — including xAI’s Grok — in search of reliable information, but their responses are often themselves prone to misinformation.

“The investigation into Grok’s performance during the first days of the Israel-Iran conflict exposes significant flaws and limitations in the AI chatbot’s ability to provide accurate, reliable, and consistent information during times of crisis,” said the study from the Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab) of the Atlantic Council, an American think tank.

“Grok demonstrated that it struggles with verifying already-confirmed facts, analyzing fake visuals, and avoiding unsubstantiated claims.”

The DFRLab analyzed around 130,000 posts in various languages on the platform X, where the AI assistant is built in, to find that Grok was “struggling to authenticate AI-generated media.”

Following Iran’s retaliatory strikes on Israel, Grok offered vastly different responses to similar prompts about an AI-generated video of a destroyed airport that amassed millions of views on X, the study found.

It oscillated — sometimes within the same minute — between denying the airport’s destruction and confirming it had been damaged by strikes, the study said.

In some responses, Grok cited the a missile launched by Yemeni rebels as the source of the damage. In others, it wrongly identified the AI-generated airport as one in Beirut, Gaza, or Tehran.

When users shared another AI-generated video depicting buildings collapsing after an alleged Iranian strike on Tel Aviv, Grok responded that it appeared to be real, the study said.

The Israel-Iran conflict, which led to US air strikes against Tehran’s nuclear program over the weekend, has churned out an avalanche of online misinformation including AI-generated videos and war visuals recycled from other conflicts.

AI chatbots also amplified falsehoods.

As the Israel-Iran war intensified, false claims spread across social media that China had dispatched military cargo planes to Tehran to offer its support.

When users asked the AI-operated X accounts of AI companies Perplexity and Grok about its validity, both wrongly responded that the claims were true, according to disinformation watchdog NewsGuard.

Researchers say Grok has previously made errors verifying information related to crises such as the recent India-Pakistan conflict and anti-immigration protests in Los Angeles.

Last month, Grok was under renewed scrutiny for inserting “white genocide” in South Africa, a far-right conspiracy theory, into unrelated queries.

Musk’s startup xAI blamed an “unauthorized modification” for the unsolicited response.

Musk, a South African-born billionaire, has previously peddled the unfounded claim that South Africa’s leaders were “openly pushing for genocide” of white people.

Musk himself blasted Grok after it cited Media Matters — a liberal media watchdog he has targeted in multiple lawsuits — as a source in some of its responses about misinformation.

“Shame on you, Grok,” Musk wrote on X. “Your sourcing is terrible.”

THE HAGUE: Turkiye’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan hailed the Iran-Israel ceasefire and urged “close dialogue” to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as he held talks with US President Donald Trump on the sidelines of a NATO summit late Tuesday.

The Turkish president “expressed his satisfaction with the ceasefire achieved between Israel and Iran through President Trump’s efforts, hoping it would be permanent,” his office said.

In the early hours of Tuesday morning, Trump announced that Iran and Israel had agreed to a staggered ceasefire that would bring about an “official end” to their 11 day conflict.

The move came after the US joined Israel’s campaign on Sunday, striking key nuclear sites, prompting a carefully-coordinated Iranian retaliation against a US base in Qatar late Monday — which appeared to bring the confrontation to a close.

Erdogan also stressed the need for Ankara and Washington to work closely to end the war in Gaza and the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

The Turkish president “emphasized the importance of close dialogue in ending the humanitarian tragedy in Gaza as soon as possible and in peacefully resolving the Russia-Ukraine war,” it said.

Erdogan also called for increased defense industry cooperation with the United States, which he said could significantly boost trade between them.

“Advancing cooperation in the defense industry would facilitate achieving the goal of a $100 billion trade volume,” he said.

BEIRUT: Colorful fireworks, sparkler-topped champagne bottles, and the occasional ballistic missile became regular features of nights out at Lebanon’s many rooftop bars and nightclubs last week, as Iran and Israel exchanged fire — providing revelers with a grim and surreal light show.

Social media has been flooded with videos of young people defiantly celebrating life as missiles arc across the night sky. This blend of dark humor and fatalistic resilience reflects a deeper yearning among Lebanese to break free from the endless cycles of conflict.

“The Lebanese love to celebrate as a way of compensating for all the crises they have endured,” Jean Beiruti, secretary-general of the Tourism Syndicates Union, told Arab News.

“Perhaps the clearest proof of this is the widely shared clips of wedding parties and nightclub gatherings even as missiles flew across Lebanon’s skies.”

This summer was meant to mark a renaissance for Lebanon — a glimmer of hope after years of economic collapse and political paralysis.

A new president and prime minister, untainted by the corruption of their predecessors, had taken office. Hezbollah, the powerful Iran-backed armed group, had been severely weakened after a devastating war with Israel.

Signs of revival had begun to appear. Tourists from across the region — notably Emiratis — were returning, choosing Lebanon as their summer retreat.

The familiar hum of vibrant nightlife had returned, and Lebanon’s famed hospitality was once again on full display, suggesting the country might finally be stepping out from the shadow of turmoil.

Yet the juxtaposition of festivity and fragility has never felt starker.

As tourists and locals embraced the promise of a carefree summer, the grim reality of regional tensions sometimes broke through.

Rocket fire streaking across Lebanon’s skies served as a chilling reminder of the ever-present threat at its borders.

“The regional developments had a limited impact on the start of Lebanon’s tourism season, particularly concerning flight bookings,” said Beiruti, reflecting on whether the Israel-Iran conflict had harmed tourist footfall.

“While all June bookings were canceled, July reservations remain unaffected so far. Tourism establishments in Lebanon are working flexibly with customers, offering incentives to maintain bookings and avoid cancellations.”

He is nonetheless hopeful that the setback will be temporary.

“If the security situation stabilizes and flights return to normal, things will go back to the way they were,” he said. “Lebanese expatriates will return with their families to spend the summer in Lebanon. They come every year regardless.

“We have already seen the beginning of Gulf tourism, with visitors arriving from the UAE, Kuwait and Qatar, as well as tourists from Egypt, Iraq and Jordan. These visitors never stopped coming to Lebanon.”

Nevertheless, the wider turmoil in the region has complicated Lebanon’s return to normalcy. Travel advisories issued by Western governments have discouraged artists and tourists from taking part in the country’s summer festivals.

Most notably, the Beiteddine Festival has postponed its program for a second year in a row.

“The opening of the festivals was supposed to feature American artistic groups, but the measure taken by the US State Department advising Americans against traveling to the region prompted us to postpone the festivals,” Hala Chahine, the festival’s spokesperson, told Arab News.

The Baalbeck International Festival may face a similar fate.

“The final decision has not been made yet, and we still have time,” Maya Halabi, the festival’s spokesperson, told Arab News. “The festivals are set to begin at the end of next July, so we can monitor the situation for a sufficient period before making the final decision.”

She added: “The main issue lies with the artistic groups that are set to participate, including those performing in “Carmen,” Georges Bizet’s masterpiece, scheduled for July 25 on the steps of the Temple of Bacchus. They are coming from Romania, Paris and Brazil.”

Tony Ramy, president of the Syndicate of Owners of Restaurants, Cafes, Night Clubs and Pastries, said the hospitality sector “had pinned its hopes on the new era in Lebanon, which brought trust and hope, as psychological factors greatly influence the tourism sector.

“Expectations were high, especially with the Arab openness to Lebanon — particularly from the Gulf countries. The Arab tourists are investors in Lebanon, property owners and big brothers to the Lebanese, and we share with them a historical nostalgia.

“Preparations were extensive, and we gathered some time ago at the Phoenicia Hotel — we, the owners of more than 400 restaurants — to declare that the sector was fully ready for the summer season.

“But the recent developments led to a drop in reservations by as much as 70 percent after airlines stopped landing at Beirut Airport.”

On the ground, Lebanese citizens — who personify the phrase ‘it is what it is’ — are living a dual reality. For many, day-to-day concerns like income and access to basic services outweigh the complexities of geopolitics.

Initially, many feared Lebanon would be dragged back into conflict if Hezbollah joined the fight at Iran’s behest. Those fears eased when the group announced it would stay out — for now.

Thomas Barrack, the US envoy to Syria, had warned Hezbollah against any action that might ignite further instability.

“I can say on behalf of President Trump... that would be a very, very, very bad decision,” Barrack said after his meeting with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri last week, responding to a question on what the US position would be on any involvement by Hezbollah in the war.

Speaking in Doha on Tuesday, Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam said his government had succeeded in avoiding a new war.

“We managed to prevent Lebanon being dragged into a new war or involvement in the regional conflict that was raging, and today we are looking forward to a new page of diplomatic action,” Salam told a press conference in the Qatari capital.

Lebanon’s recovery remains tightly bound to Hezbollah’s trajectory. Once regarded as Iran’s most formidable regional proxy, Hezbollah has been severely weakened. Over the past year, Israeli operations have decimated its leadership and degraded its military capabilities.

The US-brokered ceasefire of November 2024, which Hezbollah was forced to accept, left the group politically isolated and militarily diminished — sidelined in the latest confrontation between Iran and Israel.

Despite its historic role as Iran’s frontline against Israel, Hezbollah has refrained from attacking during the latest crisis. This restraint reflects not only the damage it has sustained, but also shifting public sentiment in Lebanon.

Many Lebanese now question the wisdom of sacrificing their fragile recovery for Iran’s regional ambitions — particularly after Tehran offered little support during Hezbollah’s darkest hours.

Under the terms of the ceasefire, Hezbollah was required to retreat north of the Litani River and surrender its weapons to the Lebanese Armed Forces — a process still underway.

The latest regional escalation began with Israel’s unprecedented strikes on Iran’s nuclear and military infrastructure, prompting missile barrages on Israeli cities. The US responded with direct strikes on Iran’s underground nuclear facilities.

The next day, Iran retaliated with missile fire targeting US forces at Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, drawing widespread condemnation. All missiles were intercepted and no casualties were reported.

While full-scale war seemed imminent, a fragile ceasefire — announced by US President Donald Trump on Monday — appears to be holding, at least for now.

Although both Israel and Iran have violated the truce in isolated incidents, the pause has allowed ordinary Lebanese to cling to the hope of avoiding further chaos.

Still, anxiety lingers. Lebanon’s recovery remains fragile, and any renewed fighting could draw Hezbollah back into the conflict — with potentially disastrous consequences.

For now, the country stands at a crossroads. The Lebanese people are determined to seize this rare moment of calm to rebuild and reclaim a sense of normal life. But the fate of that recovery may depend on the restraint of regional powers — and the endurance of the ceasefire.

Since the ceasefire was announced, Ramy said the tourism and hospitality sector had received a vital boost.

“The Arab tourists are last-minute planners,” he told Arab News.

“Now we await the Arab tourists from the Gulf, and we expect the arrival of Jordanian and Egyptian tourists. These come quickly because the distance between us is short, and they have their own hotels and restaurants they frequent. We hope for a summer similar to that of 2023.
