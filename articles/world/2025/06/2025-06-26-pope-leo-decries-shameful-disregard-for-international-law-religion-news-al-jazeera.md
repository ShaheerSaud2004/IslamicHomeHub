_Catholic pontiff says international rules have been ‘replaced by the presumed right to overpower others’._

Save articles to read later and create your own reading list.

Pope Leo XIV has lamented what he described as the rise of blunt power over the rules of international law as conflicts rage around the world and global institutions continue to fail to end abuses and war crimes.

“It is disheartening to see today that the strength of international law and humanitarian law no longer seems binding, replaced by the presumed right to overpower others,” [the pontiff](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/8/who-is-pope-leo-xiv-the-first-us-pontiff) said in a social media post on Thursday.

“This is unworthy and shameful for humanity and for the leaders of nations.”

Leo did not elaborate on his remarks, but his statement comes amid growing calls for ending the Israeli assault on Gaza, which leading rights advocates and United Nations experts have described [as a genocide](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/5/amnesty-international-accuses-israel-of-committing-genocide-in-gaza).

Israel has faced growing accusations of violating international humanitarian law, a set of rules meant to protect civilians in conflict, during its conflict with Palestinians.

Backed by the United States, the Israeli military has levelled large parts of Gaza, displaced nearly its entire population and killed at least 56,156 in the territory, according to health officials.

Earlier this month, former US Department of State spokesperson [Matthew Miller](https://www.aljazeera.com/program/newsfeed/2025/6/3/outrage-after-matthew-miller-says-israel-committed-war-crimes-in-gaza), who spearheaded Washington’s defence of Israel’s conduct during the Joe Biden administration, acknowledged that the Israeli military has “without a doubt” committed war crimes in Gaza.

Israel stands in defiance of several international resolutions, [including rulings](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/26/icj-fails-to-order-ceasefire-but-says-israel-must-prevent-genocide-in-gaza) by the International Criminal Court, the top UN tribunal, against the Israeli blockade and killings in Gaza.

Last year, the [ICJ also declared](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/19/world-court-says-israels-settlement-policies-breach-international-law) Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory – East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza – unlawful and called for its end “as rapidly as possible”.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/6/25/live-israel-iran-truce-holds-us-did-not-destroy-iranian-nuclear-programme) and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant over possible war crimes in Gaza, including using starvation as a weapon of war.

But most members of the ICC, especially in Europe, have maintained their deep trade and military ties to Israel despite the charges.

After succeeding the late [Pope Francis](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/21/pope-francis-obituary) in May, becoming the first pontiff from the US, Leo pleaded for an end to the war on Gaza.

“Ceasefire now,” Leo, the top spiritual authority for about 1.4 billion Catholics around the world, said in May.

“From the Gaza Strip, we hear rising ever more insistently to the heavens, the cries of mothers and fathers who clutch the lifeless bodies of their children, and who are continually [forced to move](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/12/israel-cuts-off-rafah-issues-new-forced-displacement-orders-for-gaza) about in search of a little food and water and safer shelter from bombardments.”

As the war in Gaza continues, deadly conflicts and reports of abuses in Sudan and Ukraine have also persisted.
